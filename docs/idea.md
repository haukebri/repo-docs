# Git-based editable Knowledge Platform

## âœ¨ my Idea

A lightweight web platform that allows both developers and non-developers to edit Markdown documents stored in a Git repository. This platform acts as a Git-backed knowledge base, accessible via a clean web interface and enhanced by AI editing support. It enables asynchronous documenting without requiring Git or code editor knowledge.

Use cases include:

- Documentation and internal wikis
- AI-assisted writing and refactoring
- Task lists and planning files

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Make Git content editable through a visual UI
- Let users work on `.md` files easily
- Enable AI-powered content suggestions or edits
- Maintain full Git history and version control
- Work even outside dev hours, tools, or technical knowledge
